The Hill Chart Application is an interactive tool for visualizing task progress using a metaphorical hill chart. It allows users to add, manage, and track tasks in a dynamic and visually intuitive way.

## Features

- **Interactive Hill Chart**: Display tasks along a stylized hill chart representing progress stages.
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, and remove tasks with ease.
- **Status Tracking**: Mark tasks as completed and see them move off the main chart.
- **Data Persistence**: Save tasks in the browser's local storage to preserve state across sessions.
- **PNG Export**: Export the current chart view as a PNG image for sharing or printing.

## Usage Instructions

### Adding Tasks

1. **Add a Task**: Click the green "Add Task" button located above the task list to insert a new task onto the hill chart. The new task is positioned in the center of the hill chart by default.

### Editing and Completing Tasks

1. **Edit a Task**: Click the task label in the task list to edit the name. You can also change the task color using the adjacent color picker.
2. **Mark as Completed**: Click the square icon next to the task label to mark it as completed. Completed tasks will appear less prominently in the list and will not be shown on the main chart.

### Removing Tasks

1. **Remove a Task**: Click the trash can icon next to the task in the list to delete the task from both the list and the chart.

### Saving Tasks

- Tasks are automatically saved in your browser's local storage. This ensures that your tasks persist even after closing and reopening the application.

### Exporting and Printing

1. **Export to PNG**: Click the blue "Export PNG" button to download the current view of the hill chart as a PNG image file.
2. **Print the Page**: Use your browser's print functionality to print the page. Note that certain interactive elements are hidden in print view for a cleaner result.
